# GEOG507/407 Spatial Analysis and Modeling

The repo hosts lecture slides, practicals, and lab assignments presented in the Spatial Analysis and Modeling course during the spring semester of 2025 at the University of Idaho (UI hereafter). The syllabus and the tentative schedule are both hosted on UI's [canvas](https://canvas.uidaho.edu/) site.
